Our team has hacked the mail of Evil Corp's IT team. 
However, their staff is quite smart; they use hashing to send critical information.
 This mail includes the login and password of the server that we need to hack. 
 Your mission is to unhash the codeâ€”the hash that ended life in 2005. Show us your skills!
