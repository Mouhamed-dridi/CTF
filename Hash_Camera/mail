Great job on the last challenge! Now, it’s time to step up your game.

After receiving the contact information of one of Evil Corp's IT staff, our hackers successfully launched a phishing attack and gained access to their email. Within the compromised mailbox, they found an email containing the login credentials for the authentication server. However, there's a catch: the username and password are encrypted. Your task is to decrypt these credentials to gain access to the server.

Once inside the server, your mission is to locate a folder that contains CCTV camera footage. The IT team has implemented complex security measures and hidden this folder, so it won't be easy to find. After you locate it, you’ll need to transfer the contents to our community’s secure server.

But there's more! Analyze the CCTV footage and find out the exact time when the IT staff leaves the office. This information will be crucial for the next challenge.

Remember, Evil Corp’s IT team is highly skilled, and the security setup is intricate. Show us your hacking skills and complete this mission. Good luck!

We're counting on you.
